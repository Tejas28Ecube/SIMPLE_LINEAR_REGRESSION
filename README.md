# SIMPLE_LINEAR_REGRESSION

THEORY_AND_PYTHON_CODE_FOR SIMPLE_LINEAR_REGRESSION
The theory contains detailed discussion about statistical and mathematical concepts required. It also contains very detailed discussion about assumptions of simple linear
regression. Diagnostic methods (both by code and graphs) to check if the assumptions are violated. It also contains remedial measures in case the assumptions are violated. 
THE ENTIRE DISCUSSION IS APPLIED, HANDS-ON AND EASY TO FOLLOW. 

It also discusses about ANOVA, F-Score and interpretation of regression results i.e. interpreting terms like R-squared, Prob(F-score), AIC, BIC seen in the output of ANOVA.
